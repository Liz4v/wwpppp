# Pixel Hawk

> [!NOTE]
> **This project is archived and no longer maintained.** I've stopped playing WPlace, so I'm no longer developing or running Pixel Hawk. The code remains available for anyone who wants to read it, fork it, or run their own instance. If your fork significantly expands functionality, I encourage you to let me know so I link back to it.

A Discord bot that watches over your artwork on [WPlace](https://wplace.live/). It polls the canvas, compares it to your project images, and tells you how your art is doing: completion percentage, progress, and who's griefing you.

Multiple people in your server can track their own projects at the same time.

## Getting started

You'll need a computer (or server) that can stay online while the bot runs. A cheap Linux VPS, a Raspberry Pi, or just your desktop works fine.

### 1. Install uv

[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is a fast Python package manager. Install it by following the instructions on the [uv installation page](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

### 2. Install Pixel Hawk

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/Liz4v/pixel-hawk.git
```

This installs the `hawk` command on your system. You can update later with:

```bash
uv tool upgrade pixel-hawk
```

### 3. Create a Discord bot

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click **New Application**, give it a name (like "Pixel Hawk"), and create it
3. Give it a pretty profile picture, too 🖼️🎨🖌️😊
4. Go to the **Bot** tab on the left
5. Click **Reset Token**, then **Copy**; save this token somewhere safe, you'll need it in a moment

### 4. Add the bot to your server

1. Still in the Developer Portal, go to the **OAuth2** tab
2. Under **OAuth2 URL Generator**, check the **bot** scope
3. Under **Bot Permissions**, check:
   - **Send Messages**
   - **Use Slash Commands**
4. Copy the generated URL at the bottom and open it in your browser
5. Select your server and authorize the bot

### 5. Configure and run

Create a folder where Pixel Hawk will store its data, and add a `.env` file with your bot token:

```bash
mkdir pixel-hawk && cd pixel-hawk
echo "HAWK_BOT_TOKEN=paste-your-token-here" > .env
```

Then start the bot:

```bash
uv run hawk
```

That's it! Pixel Hawk will initialize its database, connect to Discord, and start syncing its slash commands. Give it a few seconds to appear online in your server.

### 6. Make yourself an admin

In your Discord server, type:

```
/hawkadmin admin user:@yourself
```

Pick your own name from the user selector. This only works for the first admin; it makes you the first (and for now, only) admin.

### 7. Set the required role

Choose which role in your server gives people access to the bot:

```
/hawkadmin role name:Artist
```

Replace `Artist` with whatever role you want. Anyone with that role can now use `/hawk` commands. People without the role won't see anything. You can change this anytime.

## Using the bot

### Creating a project

1. Make your art as a PNG image using the WPlace palette
2. Run `/hawk new` and upload the image; give it a name and the WPlace coordinates where it should go
3. Pixel Hawk starts polling the canvas and tracking your art

### Watching a project

Run `/hawk watch` and pick your project. Pixel Hawk posts a message in the channel that auto-updates every time it detects changes, showing completion percentage, pixel counts, progress rate, ETA, and 24-hour activity.

### All commands

**User commands** (`/hawk`):

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/hawk new` | Upload a new project image to track |
| `/hawk edit` | Change a project's name, coordinates, state, or image |
| `/hawk delete` | Permanently delete a project |
| `/hawk list` | See all your projects with stats (only visible to you) |
| `/hawk watch` | Post a live-updating status message for a project |
| `/hawk unwatch` | Stop watching a project in this channel |

All user commands also work in DMs, as long as you've used the bot in a server at least once before.

**Admin commands** (`/hawkadmin`, server only):

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/hawkadmin admin` | Grant bot admin to a user |
| `/hawkadmin role` | Set the required role for this server |
| `/hawkadmin quota` | View or set per-user project/tile limits |
| `/hawkadmin guildquota` | View or set server-wide quota ceilings |

## Features

- **Live progress tracking**: watches your art on the canvas and reports completion percentage, pixel-by-pixel
- **Auto-updating Discord messages**: `/hawk watch` posts a message that refreshes with current stats every polling cycle
- **Grief detection**: spots when someone paints over your art and tells you who did it
- **Multi-user support**: everyone in the server can track their own projects independently
- **Smart polling**: prioritizes tiles that change often, so active areas get checked more frequently
- **Per-user and per-server quotas**: admins control how many projects and tiles each person (and the whole server) can track
- **Project states**: set projects to active, passive (piggybacks on other polls), or inactive to manage resource usage
- **DM support**: use commands in DMs after your first interaction in a server

## Advanced

### Configuration

| Setting | Default | How to set it |
|---|---|---|
| Bot token | *(required)* | `HAWK_BOT_TOKEN` in `.env` |
| Command prefix | `hawk` | `HAWK_COMMAND_PREFIX` in `.env` |
| Data directory | `./nest` | `HAWK_NEST` in `.env`, or `hawk --nest /path` |

### Running as a service (Linux)

For a server that stays online without a terminal open:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Liz4v/pixel-hawk.git ~/pixel-hawk
cd ~/pixel-hawk
bash scripts/install-service.sh
sudo nano /etc/pixel-hawk.env   # set HAWK_BOT_TOKEN here
sudo systemctl restart pixel-hawk
```

### Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Liz4v/pixel-hawk.git
cd pixel-hawk
uv sync
uv run hawk
```

Linting, type checking, and tests:

```bash
uv run ruff check
uv run ty check
uv run pytest
```
